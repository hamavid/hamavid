I stumbled into linoleum block printing by accident, through the wonderful world of Buy Nothing. Someone posted a garage clean-out with several tantalizing treasures like a spool of twine and some cello sleeves. But by time I got there those were gone, and instead I went home with a couple of unmounted 4x6 inch linoleum blocks &mdash; a material I'd never encountered before. It had a loose net weave on the back and smelled funny. Intriguing. 

Molly and I made a date to eat homefries and hack at the blocks with her X-acto knife. This was the wrong idea. I would only do this again in an emergency block printing situation.
